# zod-light
A tool for estimating Galactic zodiacal light emission for Spitzer Space Telescope observations.

# Background
This is a Python wrapper for querying the Zodiacal Light Model (written in C) by W. Reach, J. Bennett, & B. Hartley (SSC): see
https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/dataanalysistools/tools/contributed/general/zodiacallight/.

Please note that the C code has been modified to account for a couple of bugs, hence why the C code itself is included here (all rights of the C model remain with the authors as mentioned above).
