  Modules in this libBG directory have been changed to incorporate
  June2002 changes -- from Bidushi Bhattacharya's IDL changes.
  Feb2002 changes -- from Bidushi Bhattacharya's IDL changes.
  Also see ../demo/ for demonstration routines.

 README file for libBG subdirectory:

 Library for non-SFD background estimation modules is in libjbBG.a .

 Dependencies:  Routines in libjbBG call routines in the 
   ../libSFD/libjbSFD.a library.
   Routines in the IPAC coordinate conversion library, libjbcvtc.a,
   are also required.
   For installation in the Server where cspice is to be used:
     Caller must open the ephemeris file and also provide a C-callable
     routine
     "  int background_elat(double julday, double *elon, double *elat,
                            double *range) "  where returned elon and elat
     are heliocentric ecliptic longitude and latitude in degrees and
     r is distance in AU.
   The cspice library must be included in the linkage. (For testing the
     /ssc/uplink/sut/booth/NAIF/cspice/lib/cspice.a  library was used).
   Also -lm must be included in all linkages.

 For demo program see ../demo/sirtf_bgx (uses cspice). 
   Note: sirtf_bgx is simply sirtf_bg.o linked with cspice stuff instead
         of HORIZONS file reader. lksirtf_bgx.bat illustrates the linkage.

 See get_bg.c in this dir for comments on how to use the get_bg package.
    Note:  all ra and dec inputs to get_bg must be equinox J2000.
