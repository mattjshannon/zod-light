  16May2000: renamed jun1999 zkernel.c to zkernel.c_wrong and the
     jun1999 library module libjbBG.a to libjbBG.a_wrong after the
     discovery of the wrong Albedo model equations in get_Alb in
     the June 1999 version of zkernel.c .   j.bennett
  16May2000:
    In zkernel.c --
     Changed function get_Alb to correct albedo computation per Bill
     Reach's update.
  18May2000:
    In zkernel.c --
     Updated wavelength value of "1.2" in get_Alb to "1.25" per 
     Bill Reach's request.
    In scattfunc.c --
     Updated function solar_sp to return value of 0.0 when input
     argument to function is less than the value in w[0].

  06March2002 -- The March/April C code changes are to accommodate changes made
                 to the zody algorithm, in the IDL code, by Bidushi Bhattacharya.
                 The changes allow the LOS (line-of-sight) to start at SIRTF
                 instead of at Earth.
    In zdata_s.h --
      Updated structure, zdata_s, to include year.

    In get_zmod.c --
      Updated file to include comments from new IDL version of get_zmod.pro +
      Updated arg. to mk_zdata to include and use integer year +
      Updated zpar array to use new values from most recent IDL file
        zpar_fd5.xdr .

  11March2002
    In earthsun.c --
     Updated comment to include those in  new IDL version of earthsun
     in zkernel_nopartial.pro,   Updated three constants.  Did not
     implement computation of _sirtf here (seem not be be used + do not
     use any values presently in this routine).

  14March2002
    Removed get_days.c and fproot.c (called only by get_days.c) from this
    directory, since no longer used by background estimator.
    Updated Makefile.
    Removed get_bg_minmax.c and get_mnxz.c. Minmax funcs will be handled by server. 
    Appended (for a local static version) julday() from ~/clib/julday.c
              onto get_bg.c).
    Updated get_bg.c routine get_bg().
    Updated earthsun.c and get_zmod.c (both functions get new arg. lists).
    Added include file sirtfd_s.h to package.

  15March2002
    Updated some comments in get_zmod.c .
    Updated, in the file zkernel.c, the following functions:
      zcloud
      migband
      solring
      zkernel

  20Mar-22Apr2002
    Ongoing changes and updates to bg routines.
    Added sirtfsun.c - calls get_s_vals() and fills sirtfdata structure.
    Added get_cspi.c - contains get_s_vals() version that uses cspice to
                       get sirtf ephemeris.
    Added get_s_va.c that has get_s_vals() version to read HORIZONS file for 
     sirtf ephemeris for a local (non-JAVA/SPOT) version of sirtf_bg. This is
     linked using lksirtf_bg.bat and not placed in the .a library of /libBG/ .

  18Jun2002
    get_s_va.c  (for sirtf_bg and command line zody) :
      updated interpolation of elon where elon goes from close to 360 to
      close to zero.

  19Jun2002
    zkernel.c, function solring() updated to agree with new idl version
          (june2002).

  19Jun2002
     Note: days from launch not needed. What is needed in earthsun() is
           julian day no. of obs., so that the no. of days between the hard-coded
           earth lon. value date and observation date may be computed to
           get the value of earth lon. on the observation date.
    earthsun.c updated: jd (for julian day) argument added, and 
           Earth_Mean_Lon computation updated to be like new idl version.
           Included adding the julian day number for Jan 9, 2003 (came
           from HORIZON file) so # days from earth lon ref. value can
           be computed. Value agrees with IDL ver. earthsun of 21jun02.
    get_bg.c   updated: to call earthsun with additional argument jd .
               (note: jd was already being computed in get_bg() )
