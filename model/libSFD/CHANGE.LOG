 10dec1999: updated function lambert_getval_serv in subs_lambert_serv.c
            so the get_bg_fini (that calls dust_getval_fini, that calls
            lambert_getval_serv) may be called multiple times.
            Old subs_lambert_serv.c renamed to subs_lambert_serv.c_old .
            Old libjbSFD.a renamed libjbSFD.a_old.
 10dec1999 p.m.: Change to dust_getval_sub.c to make more technically
           correct -- probably will not help "fini" problem.
 13dec1999: More cleanup in subs_lambert_serv.c.  Cleaner, but previous
           (10dec1999 version) should work fine with present operating
           system.
 04feb2000: Updated subs_inoutput.h so that longer path names could be
            specified for the fits file directories. Changed values for
            MAX_FILE_NAME_LEN and IO_FORTRAN_FL from 80 to 256 .
