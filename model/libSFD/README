  sscdev1:/ssc/uplink/aire/iras649/libSFD/  for subroutine version of SFD 
  interstellar dust map routiines (Schlegel).

  Library of object modules for the SFD routines is in libjbSFD.a .

  The following files have important information concerning use of
  this subroutine package.

     NOTES
     README  (this file)
     dust_getval_sub.c  -- has comments on how to call the routines and
                           details on declarations.


  Source may be compiled with either cc or gcc compiler.

  Top level function is dust_getval_sub.  See .c file for comments on
  how to use it.  There are 4 user-callable functions:

    dust_getval_init MUST be called before any of the others.

    dust_getval_sub (used to get values from Schlegel fits files)

    trans_mask_bits (used only to translate fits files values if
                     dust_getval_sub used to retrieve mask map values which
                     are packed bit strings)
                     
    dust_getval_fini MUST be called before the main calling program
                     exits so memory may be freed.


 Also see testsub2.c for a brief sample.

 Only the following 5 routines are required by the caller wishing to 
 obtain the Schlegel dust map values and these may be compiled with cc or gcc:
    dust_getval_sub.c
    subs_lambert_serv.c
    subs_fits.c
    subs_memory.c
    subs_inoutput.c
        plus, the caller should include -lm for linkage.
