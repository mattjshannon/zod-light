		BackgroundModel

This is a stand-alone version of the IPAC background model, developed by
Bill Reach and coded by Judy Bennett. It's the same
code as is used in the AIRE server for Spitzer (spot, etc.), but with
the Java and server wrapping removed. So, it is pure c code.


The program is executed with the command line:
BackgroundModel <ra> <dec> <wl> <day> <year> <observer>
where 
  ra & dec are decimal degrees,
  wl is wavelength in microns,
  day is day of year, with the first day being day=1
  year is in range 1901-2099, but the real limits are imposed by the range
    of the ephemeris files.
  observer is a location recognized by cspice, for example "sirtf", 
    -79, planck, earth, etc.  

For example:
BackgroundModel 15 1 160.0 9 2004 sirtf
obtains the background for a sirtf observation of 1h 1d 160um on Jan 9, 2004.

The location of the ephemeris files is given in file kernel.list. 
To use the program with another observer, like Planck, you must 
change kernels.list to point to the planck ephemeris file, 
and specify "planck" on the command line.



To build the program:

First make sure that you have the library cspice.a appropriate for your
machine's architecture.  This tar file includes cspice.a for Linux 64-bit.
To obtain another version, visit the JPL NAIF site at
http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html

Then, in the top directory:

make linux
  or
make solaris
